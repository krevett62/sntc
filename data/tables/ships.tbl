Much like the standard Titan, the Assault Titan is equipped with the GTA's smallest and most modern subspace drive, giving it the tactical flexibilty to both be embedded as a support vessel for larger vessels, like the Fenris class cruiser, or to operate independent of other vessels, supporting fighter groups or opportunitically attacking vulnerable Vasudan assets.", -1)

$Short name: Titan-R

+Tech Description:
XSTR("The Recon Titan is the most modern and specialised refit of the standard model Titan Gunship currently in service. Designed as a subspace capable reconnaissance platform, the Titan-R has had much of its armament and armour removed, in favour of highly advanced, custom designed sensor systems. These modifications make the Recon Titan uniquely suited for intelligence gathering, both before and after battle.

With all of the missile weapons of the standard ship removed to make way for sensors and a more powerful reactor, the Titan-R is not a combat craft, despite being built on the frame of a warship. That said, the vessel is not completely defenceless, with its improved power output allowing it to mount 4 light plasma cannons. In addition, the removal of internal munitions, the majority of its weapons systems and its heavy armour have resulted in a significant boost to acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. These are the vessels greatest assets, as a Titan-R will almost always be deployed in short bursts, with orders to jump in, scan an area and jump out as soon as its jump drive is charged. If at all possible, combat is to be avoided. Given its high cost, advanced technology and tactical value, the GTA considers this class of vessel to be of the highest defensive priority.", -1)

XSTR("The mainstay of the Terran fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes.  From bow to stern a Fenris measures 260 meters.  With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.  It was later decided that a second line of cruisers would be produced, for defensive purposes, once it became apparent that the T-V war wouldn't be over in a few months.", 387)

$Short name: TMDBCruise
$Species: Terran
+Tech Description:
XSTR("After the Vasudans began making incursions into GTA space, Command decided that it needed a new defensive cruiser.  Changes to the Fenris led to the GTC Leviathan line of cruisers, produced as mobile defense battleships.  Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all Leviathan cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds.", 388)

XSTR("The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy.  However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat.", 405)

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.

$Short name:					TCap
$Species:                       Vasudan
+Tech Description:
XSTR("In the early stages of Vasudan space exploration thread of encountering potentially spacefaring race with hostile intentions was taken less than seriously. Only local peacekeeping forces were necessary at this time. Little is known to GTA about that era, but according to the intel provided by PVN officers after the armistice, Ramses tactical carrier was the first response to this thread and also a main logistic support ship needed in newly discovered systems. A destroyer concept was introduced in PVN after discovery of the 4th Vasudan system known to us as Altair. Empire required a unit that would combine roles of a space command center and mobile base for large complements of Anubis and Nefertum fighters able to reach newly established colonies scattered throughout planetary systems. Saviour-class light destroyer was designed to fulfil all these requirements. Faster than most lately designed destroyers and more lightly armored, its firepower and expected survivability are similar to Halcyon class next-gen frigates introduced recently to GTA arsenal.

Despite being a 2-km long battleship, the Saviour was no match for Terran Zagreus and Orion destroyer classes, primarily because its lightly armored and exposed reactors, designed to radiate the heat directly into space. This weakness was widely exploited by Terran bombers and bigger vessels early in the war, reducing total count of Saviour-class destroyers to 7 and forcing PVE to rely mostly on their Ramses carriers as their rapid fighter deployments. Later variants of the Saviour were basically classified as a new class - PVD Atum – which featured additional mid-section to cover still vulnerable reactors and more dense plating. Roles of tactical command and carrier were assigned to newer Typhon destroyers - a later descendant of the Atum class, utilizing main lines and internal structure, but eliminating majority of Atum weaknesses.

Very few of Atum class destroyers still reinforce Vasudan Navy as most of them were destroyed or replaced by Typhon class. Remaining Atums were equipped with a single spinal heavy plasma cannon and three frigate-grade additional cannons in crown configuration, making the Atum potent offensive tool and siege platform. Despite being classified as B-grade thread, firepower of Atum should never be underestimated. The destroyer is capable of performing deadly frontal jump-ins using the tactics similar to Shivan shock-jumps and bombard the target with all its four cannons. It also fully shows its potential in long and exhausting ship-to-ship duels. Cavernous hangarbays with two independent entrances are its second most important advantage. According to our intel, four vessels of this class remains in PVN service, The most notable examples are PVD Diligence of the Altair fleet and PVD Ascension from Epsilon Pegasi.", -1)
